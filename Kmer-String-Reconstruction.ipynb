    "c) I used De Bruijn Graph with Eulerian path reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct DNA sequences using k-mers. The reconstruction process involves shuffling the k-mers to prevent bias, constructing an Eulerian De Bruijn graph from the shuffled k-mers, and then finding an Eulerian cycle in the graph. We are trying to create a balanced graph which avoids already visited edges by randomly walking. The last edge in the Eulerian cycle is removed to create an Eulerian path, representing the reconstructed DNA sequence. The code prints the reconstructed sequences for different k-mer lengths (3,4,5,20,30,50) and provides insights into the efficiency of the reconstruction algorithm for various fragment sizes. "

As the kmer length increases, the similarity to original string increases. It is expected because long kmers give more information about the sequence while handling short kmers is hard since the possibilities also increase."
